# 🚗 Road Card Calculator (Kalkulator Karty Drogowej)

A web-based tool designed to assist drivers and fleet managers in automating vehicle logbook calculations. This application calculates the estimated fuel remaining in the tank based on kilometers driven and fuel consumption parameters.

## 📌 Overview

Keeping track of "Road Cards" (Karty Drogowe) manually can be tedious and prone to calculation errors. This tool simplifies the process by taking the initial and final kilometers along with the starting fuel level to automatically compute the current state of the fuel tank.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5** - Structure and layout.
* **CSS3** - Styling and responsive design.
* **JavaScript** - Logic for calculations and DOM manipulation.

## ✨ Features

* **Kilometers Calculation:** Automatically calculates distance traveled based on start and end odometer readings.
* **Fuel Estimation:** Computes the remaining fuel in the tank.
* **Validation:** Prevents incorrect data entry (e.g., negative distance).
* **Reset Function:** Quickly clear all fields to start a new calculation.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and simple design for quick usage.

## 🚀 How to use

1.  **Początkowy przebieg (Initial Kilometers):** Enter the odometer reading at the start of the trip.
2.  **Końcowy przebieg (Final Kilometers):** Enter the odometer reading at the end of the trip.
3.  **Początkowy stan zbiornika (Initial Tank Level):** Enter the amount of fuel (in liters) present before the trip.
4.  Click **Wylicz (Calculate)** to see the results.
5.  Use **Reset wartości** to clear the form.
